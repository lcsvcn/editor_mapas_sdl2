Map editor in SDL2

Map editor that I use to create a pac-man clone. I was training to dev with SDL libs, when I was in Fellowship of the game, a group of my university
But the pac-man code get lost, it thought it was in my dropbox, but now its gone. :( If find I`ll up here to see how magical is this editor
